how do I reset the external branch to the origin/external branch?

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking how to reset the external branch to the origin/external branch. This is a git question about resetting a local branch to match a remote branch. I need to provide them with the git commands to do this.

From the git status, I can see they are currently on `toxic-merged-master-20250712` branch and it's up to date with `origin/toxic-merged-master-20250712`.

To reset a local branch to match a remote branch, there are a few ways to do it:

1. If you're currently on the external branch:
   ```
   git reset --hard origin/external
   ```

2. If you're not on the external branch, you can:
   ```
   git checkout external
   git reset --hard origin/external
   ```

3. Or you can force-update the branch reference:
   ```
   git branch -f external origin/external
   ```

4. Or delete and recreate the branch:
   ```
   git branch -D external
   git checkout -b external origin/external
   ```

I should provide the user with the most straightforward approach and explain the options. Since this is a git question, I don't need to use any tools - this is just providing git command knowledge.</details></think>

To reset your local `external` branch to match the `origin/external` branch, you have a few options:

## Option 1: If you're currently on the external branch
```bash
git reset --hard origin/external
```

## Option 2: If you're on a different branch (recommended)
```bash
git checkout external
git reset --hard origin/external
```

## Option 3: Force update the branch reference
```bash
git branch -f external origin/external
```

## Option 4: Delete and recreate the branch
```bash
git branch -D external
git checkout -b external origin/external
```

**Before you do this:**
- Make sure you've fetched the latest changes: `git fetch origin`
- **Warning**: `git reset --hard` will discard all local changes on that branch. If you have uncommitted work you want to keep, stash it first with `git stash`

**Most common workflow:**
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout external
git reset --hard origin/external
```

This will:
1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote
2. Switch to your local external branch
3. Reset it to exactly match the remote origin/external branch

Choose the option that best fits your current situation!
